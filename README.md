# ASOBITICKET_v1_UltraFast
Acceralate ASOBITICKET v1(Legacy) UI
This allows faster completion of ticket purchases.

## How to use
First, load UserStylesheet.css into your browser as UserCSS. We recommend using Stylus for Chrome and Firefox.

Second, load UserScript.user.js into your browser as UserScript. We recommend using Tampermonkey for Chrome and Firefox.

Let's try.
### Notice
We recommend that you open the ticket page link on the live site exactly on time and enter the purchase page.

It does not work with the new ASOBITICKET v2. Therefore, you cannot use this method with new Lives.
There are few elements that can be reduced in ASOBITICKET v2, and even vanilla can be completed in a very short time, so it is difficult to accelerate.
